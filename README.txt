The Solder Segmentation (SolderSeg) Dataset contains 290 microscopic solder images.


Each image contains a different solder joint, and is given a unique name. Each image also comes with groundtruth labels, that are split into 3 regions, background, transition area and solder area.

This dataset can be used for image segmentation. For fair comparison, we randomly split the images into three sets, one for trainning, one for validation and one for testing.

Please cite our paper if you find this dataset useful for your research.
